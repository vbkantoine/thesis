abstract = "Based on important experimental and analytical programs, CEA has developed a wide expertise in the domain of the seismic studies of piping. The specific behaviour of piping systems, with and without flaw, under seismic loading, has been analysed. CEA has evaluated the margins coming from present design procedures, that are shown to be greatly conservative, and has developed analytical methods devoted to a better evaluation of the global behaviour (internal moments in the piping system or reactions in supports, displacements, rotations). Non-linear time–history procedures have been built that allow for accurate modelisation, with and without defect. For industrial purposes or for sensitivity analyses, simplified methods have been proposed that are much less time consuming than non-linear time–history calculations, but much more accurate than linear methods."

abstract = "In situ or laboratory experiments have shown that piping systems exhibit satisfactory seismic behavior. Seismic motion is not severe enough to significantly damage piping systems unless large differential motions of anchorage are imposed. Nevertheless, present design criteria for piping are very severe and require a large number of supports, which creates overly rigid piping systems. CEA, in collaboration with EDF, FRAMATOME and IRSN, has launched a large R&D program on enhanced design methods which will be less severe, but still conservative, and compatible with defect justification during operation. This paper presents the background of the R&D work on this matter, and CEA proposed equations. Our approach is based on the difference between the real behavior (or the best estimated computed one) with the one supposed by codified methods. Codified criteria are applied on an elastically calculated behavior that can be significantly different from the real one: the effect of plasticity may be very meaningful, even with low incursion in the plastic domain. Moreover, and particularly in piping systems, the elastic follow-up effect affects stress distribution for both seismic and thermal loads. For seismic load, we have proposed to modify the elastic moment limitation, based on the interpretation of experimental results on piping systems. The methods have been validated on more industrial cases, and some of the consequences of the changes have been studied: modification of the drawings and of the number of supports, global displacements, forces in the supports, stability of potential defects, etc. The basic aim of the studies undertaken is to make a decision on the stress classification problem, one that is not limited to seismic induced stresses, and to propose simplified methods for its solution."
