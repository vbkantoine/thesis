\section{Introduction}


Seismic fragility curves are key quantities of the Seismic Probabilistic Risk Assessment (SPRA) studies carried out on mechanical structures. They were introduced in the 1980s for safety studies of nuclear facilities (see e.g.
\cite{kennedy_probabilistic_1980,kennedy_seismic_1984,park_survey_1998,kennedy_risk_1999,cornell_hazard_2004}.
%\cite{Kennedy1980,KENNEDY198447, PARK1998, KENNEDY1999, Cornell2004}). 
They express the probability of failure of the mechanical structure conditional to a scalar value derived from the seismic ground motions -- called Intensity Measure (IM) -- such as the Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) or the Pseudo-Spectral Acceleration (PSA) for a fixed frequency and damping. In practice, various data sources can be exploited to estimate fragility curves, namely: expert judgments supported by test data \cite{Kennedy1980,KENNEDY198447,PARK1998,Zentner2017}, experimental data \cite{PARK1998, Gardoni2002, Choe2007}, results of damage collected on existing structures that have been subjected to an earthquake  \cite{Shinozuka2000, Lallemant2015, Straub2008} and analytical results given by more or less refined numerical models using artificial or real seismic excitations (see e.g. \cite{ZENTNER20101614, WangF2020,MANDAL201611,WANGZ2018,WANG2018232,ZHAO2020103}). Parametric fragility curves were historically introduced in the SPRA framework because their estimates require small sample sizes. The log-normal model has since become the most widely used model (see e.g. \cite{Shinozuka2000,Lallemant2015,Straub2008,
ZENTNER20101614, WangF2020, MANDAL201611, WANGZ2018, WANG2018232, ZHAO2020103, ELLINGWOOD2001251, KIM2004, Mai2017, TREVLOPOULOS2019,Katayama2021}).
Several strategies can be implemented to fit the median, $\alpha$, and the log standard deviation, $\beta$, of the model. Some of them are compared in \cite{Lallemant2015} highlighting advantages and disadvantages.
When the data is binary --~i.e. when it indicates failure or not~-- \cite{Lallemant2015} recommended maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). When the data are independent, the bootstrap technique can be used to obtain confidence intervals relating to the size of the sample considered (e.g. \cite{Shinozuka2000, ZENTNER20101614, WangF2020}). 

Among the various other methods not mentioned in this short introduction, the Bayesian framework has recently become increasingly popular in seismic fragility analysis (see e.g. \cite{Gardoni2002, WANG2018232, Katayama2021, KOUTSOURELAKIS2010, damblin2014, TADINADA201749, KWAG20181,Jeon2019,TABANDEH2020}). 
It actually allows to solve irregularity issues encountered in the estimation of the parametric fragility curves. MLE-based methods can indeed lead to unrealistic or degenerate fragility curves such as unit step functions when the data availability is sparse. Those problems are especially encountered when resorting to complex and detailed modeling due to the calculation burden or when dealing with tests performed on shaking tables, etc. In earthquake engineering, Bayesian inference is often used to update log-normal fragility curves obtained beforehand by various approaches, by assuming independent distributions for the prior values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such as log-normal distributions (see e.g. \cite{TADINADA201749, KWAG20181, WANG2018232, Katayama2021, Straub2008}).

This work follows the one presented in \cite{AVB2023} which deals with Bayesian problems in which only few binary data are available. Using the reference prior theory as a support, the authors have proposed an objective approach to choose the prior and to simulate a posteriori fragility curves. This approach led to the Jeffreys' prior and the authors have shown the robustness and advantages of the Jeffreys' prior in terms of regularization (no degenerate estimations) and stability (no outliers of the parameters) for fragility curves estimation. Since this prior depends only on the characteristics of the ground motion --~the distribution of the IM of interest~-- its calculation is then suitable for any equipment of an industrial installation subjected to the same seismic hazard. So, in this work, we are interested in the influence of the choice of the IM --~PGA vs. PSA~-- on the convergence of the estimates, for a given magnitude (M) - source-to-site distance (R) scenario and a given mechanical structure.

The paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:pb} presents the statement of the problem from the Bayesian viewpoint. A review of the objective prior theory is presented in section \ref{sec:objprior}. The principal achievements of \cite{AVB2023} on which we rely are summarized in section \ref{sec:construction}. Section ~\ref{sec:tools} is dedicated to reviewing estimation tools and benchmarking metrics used to support comparisons with classical approaches of the literature. They are implemented in section \ref{sec:application} on a case study, a piping system. A conclusion is proposed in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
